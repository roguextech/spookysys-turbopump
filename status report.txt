Status report




Unfortunately a lot of not so good news. 

Kevin Ford, the former NASA Astronaut who was supporting me with my PhD application, moved back to he U.S.

The professor who offered to help with the project, Ole Gunnar Dalberg, is also not answering e-mails. I guess he's busy. The solution is simple, I'll be back in Trondheim from November and will start showing up at his office.

Also, I am in need of cash and am forced to start working full time from 1st November. 

The first reason for this is that the company where I was working part time ran out of money and stopped paying me salaries. It took me two months until I got wise and terminated the project. Secondly, I had to pay a tax advisor close to 100.000 NOK to clean up a mess resulting from me neglecting my norwegian tax report while living, working, and founding a company in Germany.

Because of the above (and more, such as moving out of my apartment in Berlin), I have not made that much progress on the project, and I don't currently have a clear path to funding for my PhD application.

As I start working full time from next week, my first priority will be the PhD application. I'll keep working on the turbopump project on the side.



PROJECT STATUS

I've implemented methods for dimensioning of impellers from [1] in Python. This will allow me to drive a geometry generator and CFD-based optimizer.

As I've started realizing the scope of coding everything myself, I've started looking into software packagess. Have requested evaluation license of CFTurbo, which was used in [2].

I've researched options for the pump drive system:

Electric
- Considered simplest solution
- Very promising from a technology perspective (~25kg, within range)
- Can be built entirely from off-the-shelf parts (Plettenberg Nova 150 + MST 400-400 + 90C LiPo batteries)
- Challenge w flammable LiPo batteries, esp. in vacuum (I think solvable)
- However, motor is extremely expensive!
- Could we work some sponsorship magic??

High Test Peroxide gas generator
- Considered second simplest solution
- After much research questions remain around catalyst type (e.g. poisoning, reproducibility)
- Issues around supply

N2O gas generator
- Less used than HTP, though similar in some respects
- Catalysts are harder to build, must be pre-heated
- Danger of spontaneous decomposition must be considered 
- Decomposes extremely hot (Spray water into jet? Could not find prior art)
- Temperature sensitive, reproducibility concerns

Bipropellant gas generator
- e.g. propane/n2o, or h2/gox
- most complex solution

Tapoff cycle
- Consider it undesired, as interfers too much with engine design
